# Aliases
#
# Some people use a different file for aliases
#if [ -f "${HOME}/.bash_aliases" ]; then
#   source "${HOME}/.bash_aliases"
#fi
#
# Some example alias instructions
# If these are enabled they will be used instead of any instructions
# they may mask.  For example, alias rm='rm -i' will mask the rm
# application.  To override the alias instruction use a \ before, ie
# \rm will call the real rm not the alias.
#
# Interactive operation...
# alias rm='rm -i'
# alias cp='cp -i'
# alias mv='mv -i'

# Default to human readable figures
